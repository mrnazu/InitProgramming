<h1 align="center">1️⃣ Day 1 History of Computer</h1>

<h1 align="center">🛑 About Text , Calculator and Storage</h1>
<h5>A Brief History of the Computer</h5>

<p>The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago in Babylonia (Mesopotamia), at the
birth of the abacus, a wooden rack holding two horizontal wires with beads strung on them.
and computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. It has the ability to accept data (input), process it, and then produce outputs.</p>

<h5>A Brief History of the Computer Programming</h5>

<p>The first programming language was developed in 1883 when Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage worked together on the Analytical Engine, which was a primitive mechanical computer. Lovelace was able to discern the importance of numbers, realizing that they could represent more than just numerical values of things.</p>

<h1 align="center">2️⃣ Day 2 about OSI Model , TCP/IP and Web Attacks </h1>

<h2>🛑 What Is the OSI Model</h2>
<p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
But The modern Internet is not based on OSI</p>

<h2>🛑 What is TCP/IP</h2>
<p>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet)</p>

<h1 align="center">🛑 Difference between OSI model and TCP/IP</h1>
<p>TCP/IP and OSI are the two most widely used networking models for communication. There are some similarities and dissimilarities between them. One of the major differences is that OSI is a conceptual model which is not practically used for communication. On the other hand, TCP/IP is a model used for establishing a connection over the network.</p>

<h2>🛑 What is Website Attack?</h2>
<p>A Web application attack is any attempt by a malicious actor to compromise the security of a Web-based application. Web application attacks may target either the application itself to gain access to sensitive data, or they may use the application as a staging post to launch attacks against users of the application.</P>
<h3>Types of Website Attacks<h3>
<p>Bots<br>
DDoS Attacks<br>
SQL Injections and Cross-site Scripting<br>
Malware Attacks and etc..</p>
